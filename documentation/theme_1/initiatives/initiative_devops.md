## Test Plan

Description:
The Agile test plan focuses on implementing automated testing to catch issues early on and adapt to changing requirements.

Goals:

    Implement automated testing to catch issues early in the development process.
    Ensure that testing is adaptable to changing requirements.
    Increase efficiency and effectiveness of testing.
    Improve software quality and reduce the number of bugs.

Test Cases:

    Unit Testing: Write test cases for individual code components to ensure that each component is functioning correctly.
    Integration Testing: Write test cases to ensure that the integration between different code components is functioning correctly.
    Functional Testing: Write test cases to ensure that the software functions as expected and meets the requirements.
    Regression Testing: Write test cases to ensure that changes or updates to the codebase do not negatively impact existing functionality.
    Performance Testing: Write test cases to measure the performance of the software under different loads and stress levels.
    Acceptance Testing: Write test cases to ensure that the software meets the customer's requirements and is ready for deployment.

Dependencies:

    Availability of a suitable automated testing framework or tool.
    Availability of test cases and test data.
    Adequate hardware and infrastructure to support testing.

Risks:

    The automated testing framework may not integrate well with the development environment.
    Lack of expertise or knowledge in implementing automated testing.
    False positives and false negatives in the test results.

Mitigation Strategies:

    Conduct a proof-of-concept test to ensure that the automated testing framework works as expected.
    Provide training to team members on automated testing best practices and techniques.
    Set up a test review process to identify and address false positives and false negatives in the test results.

Estimated Effort:
Approximately 20% of the development time will be dedicated to automated testing.

Business Value:
Implementing automated testing will improve software quality and reduce the number of bugs, which will result in better customer satisfaction and fewer support requests. It will also increase the efficiency and effectiveness of testing, which will save time and resources in the long run.

Priority:
High priority, as implementing automated testing will improve software quality and reduce the number of bugs, which will benefit both the development team and the customers.

Objective:
The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the current development branch of the project is automatically deployed to team members' local environments to facilitate manual review, using Lean and Agile principles.

Scope:
The scope of this test plan includes the automated deployment process and ensuring that the current development branch is properly deployed to the local environments of team members.

Testing Goals:

    To ensure that the automated deployment process is functioning correctly.
    To verify that the current development branch is being deployed to the correct locations.
    To ensure that team members are able to access and review the deployed code in their local environments.
    To identify any issues or errors that may arise during the deployment process.

Test Cases:

    Verify that the automated deployment process is triggered when a new code commit is made to the development branch.
    Ensure that the correct version of the development branch is deployed to team members' local environments.
    Verify that team members are able to access and review the deployed code in their local environments.
    Test that any changes made to the development branch are properly deployed to team members' local environments.
    Verify that the deployment process is consistent and reliable.

Test Environment:

    Development environment with automated deployment tools.
    Local environments of team members.
    Relevant testing tools and frameworks.

Dependencies:

    Access to the development branch code repository.
    Automated deployment tools that are properly configured.
    Reliable network and internet connectivity.

Risks:

    Issues with automated deployment tools can lead to delays and errors in the deployment process.
    Changes made to the development branch may not be properly reflected in the deployed code.
    Network connectivity issues can impact the deployment process.

Mitigation Strategies:

    Regular testing and monitoring of the automated deployment process.
    Close collaboration between team members to ensure that changes made to the development branch are properly reflected in the deployed code.
    Backup deployment options in case of network connectivity issues.

Test Execution:

    Automated tests will be run to verify that the deployment process is functioning correctly.
    Manual testing will be conducted by team members to ensure that the deployed code is accessible and reviewable in their local environments.
    Any issues or errors identified during testing will be reported and resolved.

Estimated Effort:

    The estimated effort required for this testing plan will depend on the complexity of the automated deployment tools and the number of team members involved.

Business Value:

    Automated deployment of the current development branch to team members' local environments facilitates manual review and collaboration, helping to catch issues early on and adapt to changing requirements.

Priority:

    The priority of this testing plan is high, as it directly impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of the development process.
